# SAPIENZ<sup>div</sup> @ SSBSE 2019

[SAPIENZ](https://github.com/Rhapsod/sapienz) is a multi-objective search-based testing approach for mobile applications. It automatically generates test suites using evolutionary search. SAPIENZ<sup>div</sup> extends SAPIENZ with mechanisms that promote the diversity of solutions (test suites) in the search space during the search.

## Paper
Thomas Vogel, Chinh Tran, and Lars Grunske: [_Does Diversity Improve the Test Suite Generation for Mobile Applications?_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08142) In: 11th International Symposium on Search-Based Software Engineering (SSBSE'19), 2019.

## Installation and Usage
SAPIENZ<sup>div</sup> is installed and used similarly to [SAPIENZ](https://github.com/Rhapsod/sapienz).
The diversity-promoting mechanisms can be activated in the `settings.py` file.
